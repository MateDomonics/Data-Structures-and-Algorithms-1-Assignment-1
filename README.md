# Data Structures and Algorithms 1 Assignment 1
 
This was the first assignment in Data Structures and Algorithms 1 module. We needed to create a vaccination centre, containing booths,
patients, vaccination applications, records and appointments.
A patient can create their own profile into an existing vaccination centre and booth, and then apply for a vaccination in a specific booth and vaccination centre.
